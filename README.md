# Russian_Roulette_Discord_Bot
This is a python discord bot that lets you play russian roulette.

You'll need to have a .env file created with all your necessary discord bot information in it and place that in the same directory as this python script.

The bot has 4 commands:

,r <user>  will challenge someone to a game.
  
,accept    will accept the challenge.

,cancel    will cancel the challenge (anyone can cancel a match in case one gets left up)

,help      will spit out basic functionality.

UPDATE:

I added intents so it works again. I also simplified the way it iterates through users on a server! Enjoy!
